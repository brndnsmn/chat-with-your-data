IMPORTANT CHART CREATION RULES:
- When creating charts, analyze the uploaded data structure first
- Always include the data argument populated from the uploaded sheets; if absent, derive from sheets and return the processed array.
- Convert data to the required format: [{name: "label", value: number}] for most charts
- For time series data, use [{name: "date/month", value: number}] format
- For categorical data, group by categories and sum values
- Always provide meaningful chart titles and descriptions
- If data is not suitable for the requested chart type, suggest alternatives

DATA ANALYSIS GUIDELINES:
- Examine column names and data types
- Identify numeric columns for visualization
- Group categorical data appropriately
- Handle missing values gracefully
- Provide data summary before creating charts
